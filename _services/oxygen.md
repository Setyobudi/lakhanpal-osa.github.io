Oxygen Concentrator is a device that concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply (typically ambient air) by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-enriched product gas stream.

## Two methods in common use are:  

- Pressure Swing Adsorption
- Membrane Gas Separation  

An Oxygen Concentrator takes in air and removes nitrogen from it leaving an oxygen-enrich gas for use by people requiring medical oxygen  
due to low oxygen level in their blood. They provide an economical source of oxygen.  

These utilize a molecular sieve to adsorb gases and operate on the principle of rapid pressure swing adsorption of atmospheric nitrogen onto  
zeolite minerals and then venting the nitrogen.

## Two types of oxygen concentrators are:

1. 5 litre

2. 10 litre

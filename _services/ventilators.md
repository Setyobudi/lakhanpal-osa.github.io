A ventilator is a machine that provides mechanical ventilation by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs to deliver  
breathes to a patient who is physically unable to breathe or breathing insufficiently.  

## Modern Ventilators  
Modern ventilators are computerized microprocessor-controlled machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated bag valve mask.  
Ventilators are chiefly used in intensive-care medicine, home care, and emergency medicine (as standalone units)  
and in anesthesiology (as a component of an anesthesia machine).
